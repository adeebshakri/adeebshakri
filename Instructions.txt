Install node version 14.21.3
On master branch:
To run:
npm run start

Make Changes > Commit > push
Then to deploy, use:
npm run build > npm run deploy

If for some reason you loose out your changes needed to deploy, then do this(answered by chatgpt):
In package.json:
"homepage": "https://adeebshakri.github.io/adeebshakri/",
"scripts": {
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d build" // Adjust "build" to your build directory if needed
}
Run:
npm install gh-pages --save-dev
npm run build
npm run deploy
